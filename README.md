# VSCode devcontainer

This is a custom vscode devcontainer template that uses:

- Debian
- nvm latest version
- globally npm packages installed
  - typescript
  - jest
  - yarn

### Adding the definition to a project or codespace

Just follow these steps:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please see getting started information on [setting up](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started) Remote-Containers or [creating a codespace](https://aka.ms/ghcs-open-codespace) using GitHub Codespaces.

2. To use the pre-built image:

   1. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   2. Press <kbd>F1</kbd> select and **Add Development Container Configuration Files...** command for **Remote-Containers** or **Codespaces**.
   3. Select this definition. You may also need to select **Show All Definitions...** for it to appear.

3. To build a custom version of the image instead:

   1. Clone this repository locally.
   2. Start VS Code and open your project folder or connect to a codespace.
   3. Use your local operating system's file explorer to drag-and-drop the locally cloned copy of the `.devcontainer` folder for this definition into the VS Code file explorer for your opened project or codespace.
   4. Update `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` to reference `"dockerfile": "base.Dockerfile"`.

4. After following step 2 or 3, the contents of the `.devcontainer` folder in your project can be adapted to meet your needs.

5. Finally, press <kbd>F1</kbd> and run **Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** to start using the definition.
